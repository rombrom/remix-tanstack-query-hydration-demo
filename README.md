# Remix + Tanstack Query Hydration

This is a demo showing how to set up Remix SSR with Tanstack Query. The setup enables this with a minimal amount of boilerplate. It's built to accompany [my article on layers and data](https://www.rombrom.com/posts/021-endgame-data-fetching/) and how we've set this up for [Endgame](https://endgame.021.gg/).

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```
